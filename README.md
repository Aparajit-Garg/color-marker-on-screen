# CMAKE
The CMAKE is coded specifically for mac. If you use Windows or Linux, you'll need to do the required changes in the cmake to build the executable.
In a macbook with opencv build from source, just clone the repo, create a build folder in this repo and run "cmake .." in the build folder and then "make". You'll get an executable.

The mask gets update when the mouse is released. I don't know how to update it while I change the trackbar values without releasing the mouse.
